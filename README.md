## Special Thanks

This is the first mod I've ever written, and it wouldn't be possible without these awesome folks:

 * [Minecraft Forge](https://minecraftforge.net) - Aside from Forge being an awesome platform to develop for, they also
 have a fantastic forum. Special thanks to Draco18s who helped me early on.
 * [McJty's Tutorials](https://wiki.mcjty.eu/modding/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Very useful tutorials for getting
 started making mods.
 * [Mordenkainen's Equivalent Energistics](https://github.com/Mordenkainen/EquivalentEnergistics) - This mod was the
 inspiration for my mod.
